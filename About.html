<h2>About the Author</h2>
  <p><strong>Jade Saul</strong> is the pen name of <strong>Jayson Lindseth</strong>, who grew up in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. From a young age, Jayson developed a deep love for reading, especially spy thrillers, which inspired him to start writing. A writing instructor once called him the "master of plots," igniting his passion to craft compelling, twist-filled stories.</p>

  <p>Over the years, his fascination with espionage deepened, influenced by authors like Robert Ludlum, Mark Greaney, Brad Taylor, Brad Thor, and Steve Berry. His travels across Europe provided firsthand inspiration for the settings of his books, from Berlin and St. Petersburg to Copenhagen, Rome, and beyond.</p>

  <p>Jayson self-published two spy thrillers before signing with Provoco: <em>The Baltic Sanction</em> and <em>The Merchant of the Black Market</em>. His debut with Provoco, <em>Night Drop</em>, draws from real-world conflicts, weaving action and political intrigue into a gripping narrative.</p>

  <p>When he isnâ€™t writing, Jayson enjoys research, reading spy thrillers, walking, spending time with family and friends at the cabin, and working at Walmart. He continues to find inspiration in everyday life and world affairs.</p>
